I could have gone with a simpler solution, I probably could have done it quicker. 

But I wanted to experience the challenge of building my site and expanding my skills. 

This is the first post of my site. 

I wanted to experience what it is like to build my own website. 

To take a corner of the internet and make it mine

I might know a good ammount of C, and C++ but coding a whole website is a different ballgame. 

I am building this to find a job, to be able to put out what I'm thinking about the world, and as a centralized note platform for all of my classes. 

I don't know how frequently I'll write, what I do know is that it is my own writing on this site. 

Farewell, and until next time.
