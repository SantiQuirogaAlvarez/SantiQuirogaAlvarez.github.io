      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Santiago Quiroga is an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing studies in STEM with a focus on Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Data Science. He is passionate about applying science and technology to create practical solutions that improve everyday life.</p>
        <p>Santiago has hands-on experience in programming with C++, AT&T x86-64 Assembly, Python, R, and HTML, and is a Certified SolidWorks Associate. His academic background includes coursework in Calculus, Physics, Data Structures, and Statics, supported by additional training in finance and entrepreneurship through Wall Street Prep and Yale’s EXPLO program.</p>

        <p>Professionally, Santiago has worked with start-ups and small firms in both the U.S. and Mexico. At Cabin, an ecologically conscious prefabricated housing company, he integrated IoT prototypes into smart homes and implemented SEO strategies that increased web traffic by 50%. At Skyryse, he contributed to FlightOS, the world’s first universal flight deck, by researching rendering and navigational technologies for real-time airspace visualization.</p>
