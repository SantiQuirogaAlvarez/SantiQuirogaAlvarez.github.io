## Welcome

This is a starter note in your `notes` collection. It demonstrates headings, lists, code, and math support.

- Markdown with GFM tables and task lists
- Math via KaTeX: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
- Code blocks:

```ts
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Happy writing! You can duplicate this file and edit the frontmatter to add more notes.
